Installing eZ Survey extension
====================================

1. Copy the package into the `extension' directory in the root of your
   eZ Publish installation.

2. Unpack the files in the distribution. The command necessary is depends on
   the file you downloaded.
   [tar.gz]:
   $ tar -zxvf ezsurvey-extension-2.0-beta1.tar.gz
   [bz2]:
   $ tar -jxvf ezsurvey-extension-2.0-beta1.bz2
   [zip]:
   $ unzip ezsurvey-extension-2.0-beta1.zip

3. We must now enable the extension in eZ Publish. To do this edit
   site.ini.append(.php) in the folder root_of_ezpublish/settings/override. If this
   file does not exist; create it. Locate (or add) the block
   [ExtensionSettings] and add the line:

   ActiveExtensions[]=ezsurvey

   If you run several sites using only one distribution and only some of the
   sites should use the extension, make the changes in the override file of
   that siteaccess. 
   E.g root_of_ezpublish/settings/siteaccess/news/site.ini.append(.php)
   But instead of using ActiveExtensions you must add these lines instead:

   [ExtensionSettings]
   ActiveAccessExtensions[]=ezsurvey

4. Run the php script from commandline:
 
   $ php bin/php/ezpgenerateautoloads.php --extension

   Which is need to build an array of classes that are used by the autoload system 
   in PHP to load classes. You will need eZ Components availlable to run this script.

     triggers for eZ Publish. Then the schema must be filled with data.

       Text entry attribute and a survey attribute. Set the "Object name
       pattern" to the identifier of the Text entry.

     o  Survey attribute class

       Is the content class which will be used as related objects when you
       create a new survey contentobject. The class need to contain one

       attribute will be used in views for WEB pages and the "Text block" will
       be used as the text sent in Emails from the survey.

     o  Add a new content folder for the Survey attribute objects.
   
       When a new related object attribute in a survey object, the related need
