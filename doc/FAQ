[ExtensionName] extension [ExtensionVersion] FAQ

1. [ExtensionName] is not activated in eZ Publish
=================================================

You will need to check if the extension is properly activated in site.ini.
Edit `settings/override/site.ini.append' or `settings/override/site.ini.append'
and find the `ExtensionSettings' group. Under it you should have an entry
that says:

ActiveExtensions[]=ezsurvey

Make sure there are no spaces before or after the name.

You should also consider checking the debug output of eZ Publish to see what is
going wrong.

2. Survey results seem to be missing after editing the survey object
====================================================================

The survey results are coupled to the object version. When the version reaches
the version limit, older results are deleted

Therefore it is important to configure a high version limit for your survey classes:

in content.ini.append.php set the following values:

[VersionManagement]
# IMPORTANT: set the limits on the survey classes
# to a high value, otherwise survey results coupled to older versions may be deleted
#
# VersionHistoryClass[survey]=1000
# VersionHistoryClass[myothersurveyclass]=1000
